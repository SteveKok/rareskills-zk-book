## Notes

-   Magma: closed, the operation will give back values in same type `fn operation(A, A) -> A`
-   Semigroup: associative, the operation can be done in any order `operation(operation(a, b), c) === operation(a, operation(b, c))`
-   Monoid: identity element, the operation could have an identity element where, `operation(a, i) === a`, `operation(i, a) === a`
-   Group: inverse element, every element in the set have an inverse for that operation
-   Abelian group: commutative, the variable position doesn't important. `operation(a, b) === operation(b, a)`

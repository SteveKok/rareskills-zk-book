## Notes

P problem - problems that can easily solve / verified
NP problem - problems that can be verify easily
PSPACE problem - problems that are hard to verify and solve

Examples:

-   Sudoku is an example of NP problem, in order to verify a sudoku answer is valid, we just need to check and make sure that all rules are met. But to compute the solution of the sudoku, it might not be that easy.

-   Best move for chess is an example of PSPACE problem, the only way that we can verify whether a move is the best move, is to scan for all possible move and compute it again.

Circuit - A collection of boolean rules, that when all of them are true, verifies that the problem is solved.
Witness - The solution that when fit into the circuits, will generate true for all those rules. Sometimes a circuit might have multiple solution, but any one of the valid solution could be the witness

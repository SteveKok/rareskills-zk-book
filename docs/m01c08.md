# m01 c08 - Elliptic Curve Point Addition

## Notes

Elliptic Curves -> y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
Elliptic Curves intersect with linear line -> 3 intersections

Formula for Addition:

```ts
let lambda = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1);
x_3 = lambda ^ (2 - x_1 - x_2);
y_3 = lambda * (x_1 - x_3) - y_1;

// (x_3, y_3) is the sum of (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2)
```

Formula for Multiplication:

2A = A + A (One time + calculation)

1000A = 512A + 256A + 128A + 64A + 32A + 8A (14 times + calculation instead of 999 + times)

```txt
1st calculation: 2A = A + A
2nd calculation: 4A = 2A + 2A
...
9th calculation: 512A = 256A + 256A
10th ~ 14th calculation: 512A + 256A + 128A + 64A + 32A + 8A
```

Since additiona is associative, thus: (a + b)P + cP = aP + (b + c)P
